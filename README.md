# FSDS 2.0

I, Anil Kamat, am a Master of Operational Research student at Delhi University. I joined the FSDS 2.0 batch at ineuron in October 2022. This repository serves as a collection for all my Jupyter Notebook class materials.

I started this repository in 2022 and continue to learn and grow in this field daily. The knowledge and skills acquired at ineuron, Delhi University, and through various online sources contribute to the content saved here. As a BCA graduate & Operation research student & Ai enthusiast, I bring a diverse perspective to my ongoing studies and projects.



### But not gonna just lie,
### Not gonna just die,
### But keep gonna try,
### To get far high, over those skies
